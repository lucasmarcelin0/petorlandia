# PetOrl√¢ndia

This project is a Flask application for managing pets. The repository now includes basic unit tests.

## Running the tests

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Execute the tests with `pytest`:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

The tests run without needing external services or a database connection.

## Mercado Pago

To enable payment integration you must provide credentials from your Mercado
Pago account. Create the following environment variables before running the
application:

```bash
export MERCADOPAGO_ACCESS_TOKEN="<your access token>"
export MERCADOPAGO_PUBLIC_KEY="<your public key>"
export MERCADOPAGO_WEBHOOK_SECRET="<random secret>"
```

These credentials are used when generating checkout preferences and embedding
payment widgets. Never commit your real keys into version control.

After checkout, Mercado Pago will redirect the buyer back to `/payment_status/<id>`
with a `status` parameter indicating `success` or `failure`.
